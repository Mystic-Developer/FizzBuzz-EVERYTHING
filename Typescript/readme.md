Typescript is a superset of JavaScript, it adds type support to JavaScript.

TypeScript saves us time by catching errors and providing fixes before we run code.

After running TypeScript file, we get Javascript as output.

If you have node installed, you can install TypeScript by using following command

```
npm install -g typescript
```

Then execute .ts file as follows

```
npx tsc fizzbuzz.ts
```

Which gives us a .js file, which can be run with node.

```
node fizzbuzz.js
```
