# Contributing

- Fork the repo
- Work on it 
- Make a pull request (New languages only)

## Rules
- Make a new folder/directory for every new language.
- The name of the directory should be the language name and nothing else. It should be in the appropriate case: PHP/Python, not php/python
- The code must be tested to see if there are any bugs.
- Try implementing a way for the user to input how far to go on for FizzBuzz. If this is not possible in your language, set it static to go until 100.
